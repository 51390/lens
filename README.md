_"Take back control"._

Recommender systems arose with the promise of helping content consumers to make sense and take advantage of the growing amount of data available in the internet.

What we have seen after the rise of social networks and their application of recommender systems and personalization algorithms in general, however,
is that these systems have been much more optimized to maximize audience and sales metrics, leading to company profit, then to maximize their utility
to the end users.

This is an attempt to improve this situation, by providing the end users with tools that can be used to further filter content that is actually of
interest to them, instead of only taking into account the interest of big tech companies with large infrastructures and budgets.
